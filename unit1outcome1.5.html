    <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software â€“ how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="textbody">
    <p>
        In order to select the right kind of IT system or software for my job as a technical consultant, I would do this in six stages: know the objective of what I want the software to do, create a list of requirements, research, narrow my options, trial and negotiate different software and ensure that the team knows how to use it.
    </p>
    <h3>Find the software's main objective</h3>
    <p>
        I will firstly analyse my needs and find exactly why I need the software. Software tools will not fix my issues, but they may be able to streamline them and make them easier to manage. I will outline exactly what problems I want the software to be able to aid me with before I even start looking at software options. I may discuss this with members of my team.
    </p>
    <h3>Create a list of requirements</h3>
    <p>
        Next, I will look at what requirements I need for the new system. Again, I will discuss this with my team to make a more collective decision, as everyone in the company will be using the software. As well as technological requirements, such as deciding whether to use a cloud-based or in-house server, I will also outline different types of requirements such as usability to ensure that it is the correct type of software for my specific team. I will also outline budget requirements depending on how big or small my budget is.
    </p>
    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>
        I will next do some research - not just internet research, but also by asking other companies that are similar to my own for feedback on software. Similar companies' feedback and recommendations will give me a better and less biased idea of how the software works, because the software sellers could be on commission and may brush over the software's problems in order to sell their product. I will also look at reviews on the softwares' websites to see whether others like or dislike it.
    </p>
    <h3>Narrow down my options</h3>
    <p>
        Next, I will narrow down my options. I will ensure not to buy a software just because it is cheap, but at the same time I will keep an eye on the budget by focusing on what is best value for money. I will list pros and cons across the board and discuss with my team sensibly what we all think the best options are. Ideally, by this point I will only have a handful of options left to choose from.
    </p>
    <h3>Trial the software and negotiate</h3>
    <p>
        The next step will be trialling my shortened list of software. At this point in the process, I will be meticulously assessing the software against all of the requirements I had set out at the beginning. At this point, usability is particularly important. Once I have trialled all of the software and I am happy with an option, I will try and negotiate not only the price of the software but also additional things such as the set-up costs.
    </p>
    <h3>Ensure that the team knows how to use it</h3>
    <p>
        Arguably the most important stage of the process will be communicating to my team exactly how to use the new software, perhaps with a training session. This will ensure that everyone across the team is able to use the software effectively [13][14].
