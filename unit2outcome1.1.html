    <div class="textbody">
    <h3>Nav bar</h3>

    <p>
      I have first set a nav bar at the top of every page. I did this by following a W3 Schools tutorial [23], creating dropdown classes to show every subquestion on a different page of my website. I left the Home and Contact buttons without the dropdown feature because this was not needed. I kept the navbar the same and consistent on every page by styling different elements using particular class selector - a class for the hover color, a class for the dropdown button etc. I have defined these classes in my HTML file as well.
    </p>

    <h3>Static background</h3>
    <p>
      Next, I have a static background for every page, which I have set as a photo that I took in Goa, India to keep it relevant to me. I have styled this inside the whole body of the website using the CSS element selector for body. I have made sure to define the class in my HTML file as well.
    </p>

    <h3>Main page titles</h3>
    <p>
      For each page, I have a large title. On the home page, it says "Welcome to my Website" but for all the other pages, it specifies which question I am focusing on for that page. I kept this consistent and the same for every page by creating the "websitetitle" class selector and styling this in CSS. I use a striking font here which I only use for my main titles, and for About Me, to make these stand out from the rest of the text.
    </p>

    <h3>About Me ID selector</h3>
    <p>
      On my home page, I also have an ID selector for my "About Me" title. I decided to use an ID selector for this because it is the only page where I am having a different type of title (not one of the outcome questions), and ID selectors can only be used once.
    </p>

    <h3>Full sub-questions as titles</h3>
    <p>
      I added another class selector on each page for the full sub question on that page. Having this in a separate box makes it easier for people to read as well as being more visually pleasing. The colour for this is the same as the main page titles so that they are linked aesthetically, but the font is the same as the main body text below to link these titles aesthetically to that too.
    </p>

    <h3>Main paragraphs</h3>
    <p>
      For the main paragraphs on each page, I created another class selector, again to keep consistency throughout the website. I made the background for this text less transparent than the background for the titles so that it is easier to read the text (because it's a lot smaller than the titles' text).
    </p>

    <h3>References</h3>
    <p>
      On every page where I include references, I include links to these at the bottom of the page. I included a slightly larger title, in the same yellow colour as the subheadings and main page titles to keep this consistency throughout the site. But again, I used the same font as the body text for this heading to show that it is just a subheading. I included clickable URLs for each reference that lead to the original articles. I also redirect each hyperlink to open in a new tab for better accessibility.
    </p>

    <h3>Contact form</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, I have included a contact form on my contact page so that visitors to my website can directly contact me if need be. I made the form by combining a few different elements, including to creating a container, creating blank fields to write text and creating a button for people to submit messages to me [24].
