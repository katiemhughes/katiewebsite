      <h3>Improving accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      I could definitely research further into how to make my website more accessible. Currently, the only accessible feature I have included is targeting links to open in a new tab, but I can definitely do more to improve accessibility. One thing that I could do is increase the size of the submit button on my contact form, and ensure that the whole shape of the button is clickable (not just the text). I could also add contrasting colours, and error messages that bring the user back to the form if they make a mistake when filling it out. All of these things will greatly improve my website's usability for visually impaired people in particular.
    </p>
    <h3>Flexbox</h3>
    <p>
      Another improvement that I could make is using flexbox for my design. By using the flex-wrap feature, I would have been able to make my website more responsive to mobile and tablet devices. This would allow my content to fit the size of whatever device someone uses to view it. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Flexbox would also allow me to improve the aesthetic look of my website, giving an alternative layout to simple vertical text. It would allow me to place my content in various ways, such as a block format or in columns, to make things look more interesting.
