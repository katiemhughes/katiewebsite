    <h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects â€“ How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="textbody">
    <h3>How GDPR impacts digital projects</h3>
    <p>
        GDPR is short for the EU Data Protection Regulation which is designed to protect individuals' data. It was implemented on the 25th May 2018. The regulation has 6 aims, to give people:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data portability</li>
      <li>The right to be forgotten</li>
      <li>The right to prevent profiling</li>
      <li>The right to object to processing</li>
      <li>The right to rectification and erasure</li>
      <li>Subject access requests</li>
    </ul> 
    <p>
        If companies do not comply with the GDPR regulation, they could face fines equivalent to 4% of turnover or up to $20 million [17].
    </p>
    <p>
        GDPR impacts digital projects such as website design, because every website created in the EU now has to contain a pop-up explaining that their website uses cookies to track their behaviour and an explanation about how their data can be used, with a button for the user's consent. This could be an annoyance or even worrying for some users [18].
    </p>
    <h3>General legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3>
    <p>
        As well as the GDPR guidelines, there are some other legislations that businesses should be aware of when carrying out digital projects. 
    </p>
    <h4>Companies Act 2006</h4>
    <p>
        One of these is the Companies Act 2006 which requires companies to be transparent about their identity on their website. This needs to include the company's name, their registered number, place of registration, registered office address, company email address, postal address, VAT number and names of any trade bodies that the company is part of. 
    </p>
    <h4>Equality Act 2010</h4>
    <p>
        Another legislation that people carrying out digital projects need to be aware of is the Equality Act 2010. People carrying out digital projects need to be compliant to this legislation when thinking about accessibility in their project. All projects need to meet specific minimum guidelines.
    </p>
    <h4>Copyright</h4>
    <p>
        Finally, those carrying out digital projects need to respect copyright. You need to make sure that you are only using licenced or royalty free images and also ensure that you protect your own website's copyright [19].
