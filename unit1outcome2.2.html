        <h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
        </div>
  
      <div class="textbody">
      <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
      <p>
        Visual Studio Code was very appropriate for the task because it is a very clear and concise text editor. I was able to toggle between my many HTML pages and my CSS file quickly and easily. 
      </p>

      <h3>Trello</h3>
      <p>
        Trello was also very user friendly - it helped me to stay organised and on top of my work. The feeling of ticking off my tasks and moving them to the "Done" column was motivating, and helped improve my productivity. However, I think that Trello is generally better suited to team work so that features such as comments and the activity timeline can be used to their full potential.
      </p>

      <h3>Padlet</h3>
      <p>
        Padlet was useful for mapping out my research, but I did wonder at times whether I was creating even more work for myself than needed. Perhaps if I had not used Padlet then I could have saved a bit of time.
