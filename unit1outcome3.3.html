      <h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects â€“ what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
      </div>
  
      <div class="textbody">
      <h3>Team work to increase productivity</h3>
      <p>
        Next time, I would definitely work in a team to increase productivity. If I had worked in a team, I would have been able to split up the work and distribute it equally amongst my team members. This would have meant that I would not have had so much work to do, and I could have completed my tasks much faster.
      </p>
      <h3>Use of Slack</h3>
      <p>
        If I was working in a team, I would have used Slack as well as the systems that I had already used (Visual Studio Code, Trello and Padlet). Slack would have helped me to work efficiently and collaboratively with my team through easy and constant contact through their instant messaging system. This would aid the team's communication, leading to us being more productive and efficient.
      </p>
      <h3>Use of Trello and Padlet</h3>
      <p>
        My use of Trello and Padlet would also be greatly enhanced if I was working on them alongside my other team members. On Padlet, I would be able to check out different research articles that my team members had uploaded, which I could have missed myself during my Google searching. On Trello, I would be able to keep up to date with the stages that team members were at in their work. If they were struggling with a particular piece of work, I would be able to use the Trello board to identify the particular piece of work and then help them with it. Likewise, if I was struggling with something, then one of my team members could do the same for me.
