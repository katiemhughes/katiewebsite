    <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="textbody">
      <h3>Copyright</h3>
      <p>
        Everything on a website is automatically copyrighted to whoever made it, and there is no need to register it, however it will expire. As a rule, copyright lasts for the duration of the author's life plus 70 years after that. It is illegal to share something that is copyrighted before this expiration date, so when making a website, you need to ensure that all content is either your own, or have explicit permission from people to use their content, images, audio, videos etc before launching [25].
      </p>

      <p>
        If using a database, search engine or other software which is licenced by someone else, it is necessary to check the terms in the licence agreement. It is advised to ensure that you have an agreement before launching the website and having this checked over by a lawyer to avoid legal issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are websites such as Unsplash and Shutterstock where you can obtain royalty free and stock photos that are all licenced and safe to use, but you will need written permission to display images from elsewhere [26].
      </p>

      <h3>Other constraints</h3>
      <p>
        You may also need to ensure that your domain name isn't already owned by a third party, and check with the Intellectual Property Office that your branding isn't the same or very similar to someone else's, as this could infringe on their rights. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Something else to consider is libel. You need to ensure that you are not writing any defamatory comments on your website, as this could lead to a defamation claim, for which you can get fined huge amounts of money [27].
