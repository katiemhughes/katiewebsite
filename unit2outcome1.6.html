    <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>

    <p>
        There are many different types and degrees of disability, so when thinking about making websites accessible, it is important to take every one of these into account. This is by no means an exhaustive list, but these are some of the issues that need addressing when creating a website to make things more accessible.

    <h3>Something that can trigger a seizure</h3>
    <p>
        Websites that include videos and gifs with sudden flashes and fast moving imagery can cause seizures for many people who suffer from epilepsy. By including an opt-in feature for videos and even gifs, this trigger can be removed for users with epilepsy, without having to eliminate the use of these features from your page altogether.
    </p>
    <h3>Videos without captions</h3>
    <p>
        Subtitles have been a well-known accessibility tool for a long time, but sometimes subtitles on their own are not enough for deaf users. Captions, on the other hand, describe other things that are happening in the audio to give more context to the video and help deaf users figure out what is going on.
    </p>
    <h3>Photos without descriptions (tags)</h3>
    <p>
        One of the most basic features of HTML is being able to add a description to a photo via a tag. This is to describe it if the image link is broken, but even more importantly, for voice assistance software to be able to describe the photograph. If an image does not include this description, then there is a risk of visually impaired people missing vital information on your website, which is why it is good practise to always include a tag for each image [20].
