    <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. â€“ How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your code's version control?</h2>

    <h3>Trello</h3>
    <p>
        Trello has helped me lay out my tasks as if they were on a kanban board. This has helped me visualise my workflow and know exactly when to take action and complete tasks. The due dates on my Trello board have acted as a type of WIP limit, because when the due date is fast approaching, the traffic light symbol turns red. This has helped to apply pressure for me to press on and get the task done, before working on the next one. 
    </p>
    <h3>Padlet</h3>
    <p>
        Using Padlet to map out my research was also useful. At the beginning of answering my questions, I was using too many articles which weren't actually very useful. The 5 star system made me realise which kind of articles were actually useful for me (often ones which are more concise but still cover all the points that I need to answer). This allowed me to save time and answer the questions faster.
    </p>
    <h3>Git and Github</h3>
    <p>
        Git is a version control system that is stored locally on your computer, which gives you the ability to give your code branches. This will allow me to try out and set aside ideas in my code without having to commit to them immediately. With Git I will be able to track and log the changes that I make in my code over time locally. GitHub will allow me to do this on a cloud-based system in a repo (master folder) and allow others to collaborate with my project and help me make improvements to my code [15].
    </p>
    <p>
        It will also allow me to keep track of the history of my project, look back and see what it looked like at different points. For example, if I had originally chosen to center some text, then abandoned the idea but then decided to reintroduce it again, I would be able to track all the way back to where I had originally decided to center it and then implement that again [16].
