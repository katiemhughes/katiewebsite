      <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
      </div>
  
      <div class="textbody">
      <p>
        In order to improve my own productivity, I ensure to do a few different things:
      </p>
      <h3>Meditation</h3>
      <p>
      I meditate every morning before class. This allows me to take the time to clear my mind ready for the day ahead, and also take the time to set my intentions for the day once the meditation session is over. This helps to improve my wellbeing and keep me calm throughout the day, which also greatly improves my productivity and work speed.
      </p>
      <h3>Yoga</h3>
      <p>
      I have taken part in both yoga sessions organised by CodeNation and these have really helped my productivity levels. I was considering not joining the session this week because I was very stressed with my workload for creating my website, but I was so glad that I went. It calmed my heartrate, and when I went back to work, I produced twice as much content as I had been before I attended the yoga session, because I was calmer and more clear-headed.
      </p>
      <h3>Stretching and taking breaks</h3>
      <p>
      I take regular breaks away from my desk. When I work, I sit at my kitchen table on a rather uncomfortable chair, which hurts my back after I am sitting on it for too long. This can impact on my productivity because if I am in pain, I will not get as much work done. To combat this, every few hours I will stand up, do a few stretches and take a short walk around my apartment to refresh my body. When I sit back down, I feel more comfortable, energised and ready to take on more work.
      </p>
