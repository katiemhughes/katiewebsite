    <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
    </div>
  
    <div class="textbody">
    <p>
      In order to test my digital solution (in this case my website), I use Live Server to view the website from the front end. This allows me to have a visual idea of what the website looks like, instead of just looking at the code. This is important because even when we know how to code something in Visual Studio, there is a chance that it could appear completely different on the front end view of the website to how we imagine it in our heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      My testing process is to keep on looking back and forth constantly between live server and my code, with a split screen. In this way, I am able to spot problems in my code immediately, and begin solving them quickly, instead of missing things accidentally and having to trawl back through hundreds of lines of code to rectify the problem. 
    </p>
    <p>
      An improvement that I could make in my testing process is to have someone else test it for me. I could ask someone to do this at a few different stages throughout my project - not just before I launch the project/go live. By doing this, I would assure that everything looks good through a different pair of eyes. I could also get an outsider's perspective on the clarity of my website - for example, have the person testing check whether everything was readable, and accessible.
