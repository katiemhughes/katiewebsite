    <h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
    </div>
    
    <div class="textbody">
    <h3>Marketing and business growth</h3>

    <p>
        IT is a great tool for marketing and business growth. Digital marketing is essential for any modern business. Marketing strategies such as using influencers and social media advertising are some of the most effective ways nowadays to grow a business and target an audience. There are many other aspects of digital marketing as well, such as search engine optimisation (SEO), blogging, forums, email marketing, pay per click (PPC) and smartphone app advertising. As digital marketing nowadays is so hugely vast, it would be pretty much impossible for modern businesses to be able to grow without it. 
    </p>

    <h3>Helps improve communication between employees</h3>

    <p>
        IT is also extremely useful for effective communication between company employees. Depending on the type of business, different IT communication tools are used. Some may use instant messaging systems such as Slack, and others may use video conferencing such as Zoom or Skype. Good communication means that employees are more driven, co-ordinated and better informed about the tasks that they need to do. Breakdowns in communication can cause problems between employees which in turn can be harmful to the business. The purpose of digital communication is to stop this from happening and to keep every member of the business connected [1].
    </p>

    <h3>Cyber security and protection against attacks</h3>

    <p>
        The use of cyber security systems are very important in modern business to protect companies against online cyber attacks and data theft. Data breaches can be extremely damaging for businesses and their clients - for example the Capital One data breach where hackers gained access to 100 million Capital One accounts [2]. If businesses want to stay afloat, they need effective firewall and antivirus systems in place in order to stop these breaches from happening. 
    </p>

    <h3>Better decision making</h3>

    <p>
        IT also plays a very big role in decision making in modern business. Big data analytics and other IT analytics tools such as Google Analytics and Microsoft CRM Dynamics [3] have been pioneering for businesses to be able to show them things like purchasing patterns - they also give businesses the ability to track customer and client behaviours. Market research conducted using IT, such as online surveys are also vital for businesses in order to be able to research wider groups of people [4].
