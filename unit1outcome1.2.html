    <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully - what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="textbody">
    <h3>Agile</h3>

    <p>
    In order to complete a digital project successfully, you need to implement the Agile project management methodology according to its manifesto values:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Individuals and interactions over processes and tools</li>
      <li>Working software over comprehensive documentation</li>
      <li>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation</li>
      <li>Responding to change over following a plan [5]</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Agile frameworks such as Scrum and Kanban</h3>

    <p>
        Particular frameworks are needed to implement the Agile values, such as Scrum and Kanban [6]. Many modern businesses implement this methodology with a hybrid of frameworks, for example the use of Scrumban, which is what Code Nation use for their digital project management. They use Kanban to limit their work in progress, and maximise flow (efficiency), by using a kanban board. They also use elements of the scrum method such as having stand-up meetings and "retros" (retrospectives) to keep up to date with team members about progress [7].
    </p>

    <h3>What skills and tools are needed for Scrum?</h3>

    <h4>Backlog</h4>

    <p>
        The first tool needed for scrum is a backlog (a list of tasks and requirements needed to make the product). You can record the backlog on a software such as Trello or a real-life whiteboard.
    </p>

    <h4>Specific team roles</h4>

    <p>
        Scrum teams use three defined team roles. First is the Product Owner, who represents the final user of the product, takes care of the backlog and uses it to prioritise tasks. Secondly is the scrum master who helps the team stick to the scrum principles. Finally there is the development team that chooses the work to be done and builds team accountability.
    </p>

    <h4>Sprint</h4>

    <p>
        Another thing that is needed is a timeframe for the team in which they will complete all of the tasks in the backlog. This is called the Sprint. The stand-up meetings which I mentioned prior are part of the sprint, and these are done daily to give progress updates to the team. Each sprint, which is usually around two weeks long, ends with a Retro where the team reviews their work to learn from it and improve it next time around [8].
    </p>

    <h3>What skills and tools are needed for Kanban?</h3>

    <h4>Kanban board</h4>

    <p>
        Kanban is based on task prioritization, which is represented by cards on a kanban board (Trello can be used digitally, or a whiteboard in the office). Cards are separated into workflow stages - To Do, In Progress, In Review, Blocked, and Done.
    </p>

    <h4>Work in progress (WIP) limits</h4>

    <p>
        Work In Progress limits cap the amount of cards in a column on the kanban board at a time. When a limit is reached, the team focuses on that task to get it done and move it forward.
    </p>

    <h4>Change philosophy</h4>

    <p>
        Kanban is much more fluid than scrum as its workflow changes all the time. There is no single "kanban master", there are no particular timeframes to complete tasks and it's the responsibility of the team to make changes to the kanban board [9].
    </p>

    <p>
        There are other methodologies which are used for project management such as Waterfall, but Agile, Kanban and scrum are widely considered to be more productive in the digital industry [10].
