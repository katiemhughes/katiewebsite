      I selected and used appropriate development techniques to link information across pages by using two methods.
    </p>
    <h3>Nav bar</h3>
    <p>
      Firstly, I used dropdowns in my nav bar to create a more appropriate way to link information across my website. If I hadn't created dropdown options for each sub-question in each unit, my nav bar would have looked very disorganised and may have been disorientating for people. However, the dropdowns help for both appearance and usabillty. They are hidden until you hover over them, which means that the user can still access the pages for each sub-question easily - it just keeps the nav bar's appearance much neater. 
    </p>
    <h3>Hyperlinks</h3>
    <p>
      The other technique that I used to link information was the inclusion of my references at the bottom of each page where needed. I used the anchor tag to make the hyperlinks usable and I also targetted them all to new tabs to improve accessibility once again. I also linked my Trello and Padlet boards onto new tabs for the same reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also provided error free pages that are fit for purpose, by ensuring that I was looking back at live server every time I made a change on my site. This ensured that I would realise if I had made an error in my HTML and CSS, because it wouldn't look "right" on the live server. Constantly checking this meant that I could go back and change every error as I was going along, rather than having to go back and change everything at the last minute at the end.
