      <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed â€“ in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello</h2>
      </div>

    <p>
      I am happy with the tools I used, but I did feel a bit restricted at times.

    <h3>Lack of PHP knowledge for contact form</h3>
    <p>
      When attempting to create my contact form, I could only get so far with HTML and CSS. If I had been able to use PHP for this, it would have made my form fully functional.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Trello</h3>
    <p>
      I also found Trello useful. At the beginning of my project, I didn't realise that there was a due date reminder. However, halfway through my project, I had a closer look at Trello to check if there were any good features I was missing, and then found this feature. I found it useful, so I used it to measure my deadlines at a crucial point in my project - when it was nearing an end.
    </p>

    <h3>Padlet</h3>
    <p>
      Padlet became more and more useful for me as the project progressed. The reason for this is because the ratings system made me realise early on that I was reading too many articles that had irrelevant content. Mapping out my research on Padlet and seeing which types of articles I was giving 4 and 5 stars allowed me to recognise what kinds of articles I find more useful. This ended up being articles in short, concise bullet points rather than pages and pages of useless information.
