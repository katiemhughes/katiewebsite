      <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency â€“ could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>

      <h3>Trello</h3>
      <p>
        I think that Trello was a useful tool for my own productivity, because the traffic light system (red for an overdue task, yellow for when a deadline is fast approaching and green for finished tasks) really helped me to stay motivated and get my tasks finished on time. This worked so well for me because I work really well under pressure. However, I think that using Trello in a team and allocating particular tasks to each team member on the board would have made things even more efficient. I could have also made use of the activity history to see how quickly everyone else was finishing their tasks as an extra motivator (or seeing if they were behind, and then encouraging them to work faster)!
      </p>
      <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
      <p>
        I really liked using Visual Studio Code because it is very clear in the way that it highlights different tags and elements in corresponding colours. I am a visual learner, so tools that use visual elements like this really help me. I think that using Visual Studio in teams would have been a little bit limiting because there is no option for using it in a collaborative way.
      </p>
      <h3>GitHub</h3>
      <p>
        I think that I could have used GitHub as an extra tool to help with productivity and efficiency. On GitHub, it is possible to allow others to suggest and implement improvements in your code, so I could have used this tool for collaboration. This could have improved my teamworking skills as well as allowing me to learn new ways of implementing my code from others. I will do this when making websites in future as an extra aid.
