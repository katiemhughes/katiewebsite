      <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency â€“ could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>

      <h3>Trello</h3>
      <p>
        I think that Trello was a useful tool for my own productivity, because the traffic light system (red to signal when a task is overdue, yellow to signal when a deadline is fast approaching and green when a task is done) really helped me to stay motivated and get my tasks finished on time, because it put me under pressure. I work really well under pressure so that is why this worked so well for me personally. However, I do think that using Trello in a team and allocating tasks to each person on the board would have made things even more efficient. I could have made use of the activity history also, to see how quickly everyone else was finishing their tasks, as an extra motivator (or seeing if they were behind, and then motivating them myself to encourage them to work faster)!
      </p>
      <h3>Visual Studio Code</h3>
      <p>
        I really liked using Visual Studio Code because it is very clear in the way that it highlights different tags and elements in corresponding colours. I am a visual learner, so things like that really help for me. I do think that using Visual Studio in teams would have been a little bit limiting because there is no option for using it in a collaborative way.
      </p>
      <h3>GitHub</h3>
      <p>
        I think that I could have used GitHub as an extra tool to help with productivity and efficiency. On GitHub, it is possible to allow others to suggest and implement improvements in your code, so I could have used this tool for collaboration - to improve my teamworking skills as well as learning new ways of implementing my code from others. I will do this when making websites in future as an extra aid.
