        <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects - what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="textbody">
    <p> 
        According to a digital effectiveness survey by Code Computerlove, 97% of companies had digital projects that had failed in the past. When it came down to mainstream companies versus the top performers, the former said that 30% of their projects frequently fail, compared to 15% for the latter.
    </p>
    <h3>Main risk for mainstream companies</h3>
    <h4>Unclear strategy</h4>
    <p>
        What mainstream companies struggle most with, according to the survey, is poor definition of an initial goal and strategy to reach this outcome. These companies struggle to know what their goal looks like at the beginning of their project, which makes it difficult to actually achieve it at the end. 
    </p>
    <h3>Main risk for top performing companies</h3>
    <h4>Trying to do too much work at once</h4>
    <p>
        On the other hand, whilst top performing companies are more focused on goals and outcomes, they struggle with trying to do too many tasks at once and getting caught up with short term tasks [11].
    </p>
    <p>
        Overall though, many digital projects fail because they are so innovative, and with innovation and creative projects always comes an element of risk because they come from original ideas which may have not been tested before. They require lots of meticulous planning up to the very small details, and effective collaboration to work [12].
