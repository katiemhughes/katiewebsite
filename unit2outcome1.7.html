    <h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
    </div>
  
  <div class="textbody">
  <p>
    The main appropriate file types for websites are HTML, CSS, PNG and JPG/JPEG.
  </p>
  <h3>HTML</h3>
  <p>
    HTML (short for Hyper Text Markup Language) documents are essentially the bare bones of a web page, and they make up the web page's structure. In the HTML file, the structure is defined through particular tags, for example defining divisions in the web page, where paragraphs start and end, and line breaks. It is possible to do very simple styling such as make text bold or italic. HTML document file names end in .html.
  </p>
  <h3>CSS</h3>
  <p>
    CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, are used alongside HTML tags to make website content look more visually pleasing and interesting. CSS can be used inside a HTML file, but a standalone CSS filetype is called an External Stylesheet. CSS can allow a developer to add features to a webpage such as a background image, different fonts, font sizes and much more. CSS filetypes end in .css.
  </p>
  <h3>PNG/JPEG</h3>
  <p>
    PNG and JPEG are two types of image file regularly used for websites. JPEG files are a smaller file size but they offer no transparency support. They are also made up of lossy compression meaning images slightly lose their quality each time they are opened and saved again. Whereas, PNG files do offer transparency support whilst being of a bigger file size, and they are lossless which solves the compression issue with JPEG [21].
  </p>

  <p>
    Some other files that are used are MP3 and MP4 files which are used to contain audio and video respectively. Two more image formats are GIF, which is used to display moving bitmap images, made up of tiny pixels - though this filetype can only store graphics with a few colours. There is also the lesser known SVG filetype, which is used to display vector graphic illustrations (based on geometric shapes). They maintain the highest quality of any image filetype when resized. This filetype is especially useful for logos [22].
