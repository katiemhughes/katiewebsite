      <h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project â€“ are you happy with  your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>

    <p>
      I am happy with the colour scheme of my website. I used a picture of my travels in India as my background image because travelling and taking photographs whilst travelling is one of my main hobbies. I also really like the green colour scheme that matches my background image, because green is my favourite colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am also happy with the colours, font and general style of my nav bar, but if I had more time, I would have liked to have learnt how to make this span across the whole screen instead of stopping just before the end of the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would have liked to have known how to make rounded borders for my text boxes for aesthetic appeal, but unfortunately I did not have enough time to do this either.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, one more thing that I would have liked to have done is make my form on my contact page a working form. However, to do this, I needed to know PHP, which unfortunately wasn't taught on this course. In the future, I would like to learn how to code in PHP to make extra useful things for my website such as this form.
